Description: Implements three families of parsimonious hidden Markov models (HMMs) for matrix-variate longitudinal data using the Expectation-Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm. The package supports matrix-variate normal, t, and contaminated normal distributions as emission distributions. For each hidden state, parsimony is achieved through the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrices associated with the emission distribution. This approach results in a comprehensive set of 98 parsimonious HMMs for each type of emission distribution. Atypical matrix detection is also supported, utilizing the fitted (heavy-tailed) models.
